# vaccination-exercise

THL has ordered us to create a vaccination database which contains information about vaccine orders and vaccinations.

We have received files which contains the base data for the application

The Orders are in different files named by the manufacturer of a vaccine.

Injections must be used in 30 days after the arrival of the bottle.

[name].source "Zerpfy"|"Antiqua"|"SolarBuddhica"

The source file has one json item per line.

## Format of an order

```json
{
  "id": "universal identifier of the order",
  "healthCareDistrict": "HYKS|KYS|OYS|TAYS|TYKS",
  "orderNumber": "Rising number of the order",
  "responsiblePerson": "Name of the person who is responsible to track the delivery",
  "injections": "number of injections available in a bottle",
  "arrived": "ISO datetime",
  "vaccine": "Zerpfy|Antiqua|SolarBuddhica"
}
```

## Example order

SolarBuddhica.source:

```json
{
  "id": "2b00bc58-3faf-4d06-bb11-ef47aad8086a",
  "orderNumber": 4194,
  "responsiblePerson": "Arhippa Pihkala",
  "healthCareDistrict": "TYKS",
  "vaccine": "SolarBuddhica",
  "injections": 6,
  "arrived": "2021-04-07T01:10:30.696768Z"
}
```

## Vaccination structure

vaccinations.source is a json array which has information of all the vaccinations currently made

The datastructure is

```json
{
  "vaccination-id": "universal identifier of the vaccination",
  "gender": "male|female|nonbinary",
  "sourceBottle": "universal identifier of the bottle",
  "injected": "Datetime"
}
```

## Example vaccination

```json
{"vaccination-id":"e28a0fb5-3956-4ba6-827f-4dcae64e4cda",
"sourceBottle":"2b00bc58-3faf-4d06-bb11-ef47aad8086a",
"gender":"nonbinary",
"vaccinationDate":"2021-04-08T11:00:20.740994Z"}
```

# The exercise

Make a web application for presenting some interesting data about the vaccinations.

## Technology choices

Feel free to use whatever you think is best for this kind of stuff.

React/Vue.js/Angular or something else for the frontend. All is fine.

Node.js/Clojure/Go/Rust/Kotlin or something else for the backend.

Some kind of database could be useful for aggregating the data. MySQL/Postgresql/Oracle/FreemanDB or maybe noSQL?

## List of interesting things

For given day like 2021-04-12T11:10:06

* How many orders and vaccines have arrived total?
* How many of the vaccinations have been used?
* How many orders/vaccines per producer?
* How many bottles have expired on the given day (remember a bottle expires 30 days after arrival)
* How many vaccines expired before the usage -> remember to decrease used injections from the expired bottle
* How many vaccines are left to use?
* How many vaccines are going to expire in the next 10 days?

Perhaps there is some other data which could tell us some interesting things?

## Some numbers to help you

* Total number of orders 5000
* Vaccinations done 7000
* "2021-03-20" arrived 61 orders.
* When counted from "2021-04-12T11:10:06.473587Z" 13620 vaccines expired before usage.

## Some tips

* You don't need to do all these for a good result.
* You can make graphs from the data but textual representation suffice also.
* Think about the tests for your application.
* You can test the frontend also
* Add README.md which have instructions how to build/run your software and how to run the tests.

## What is this Clojure code in this repository?

It was used to generate the sources.
